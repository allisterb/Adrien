## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2017 15.7.5 or higher
* .NET Core v2.0.5 or higher

## Steps
Either:
 * Build the solution from the Visual Studio Solution Explorer or
 * Run `build.cmd` in the solution folder from a VS 2017 x64 developer command prompt.        

If Visual Studio or the `msbuild` CLI complains about missing packages then you may have to add the Adrien NuGet dev
feed @ https://www.myget.org/F/adrien/api/v3/index.json.
